# Predator-Prey Dynamics Using Lotka-Volterra Equations  

## Overview  
This repository presents a mathematical modeling project based on the Lotka-Volterra equations, which describe the interaction dynamics between predators and prey in an ecological system. The project focuses on modeling the evolution of lizards (prey) and bird species (predators) under various environmental influences, including pesticide use and resource limitations caused by deforestation.  

## Features  
- **Simplified Model**: Implements the standard Lotka-Volterra equations to simulate predator-prey interactions.  
- **Modified Models**:  
  - Incorporates pesticide effects on population dynamics.  
  - Adds resource limitations to reflect the impact of deforestation.  
- **Numerical Simulations**: Solves the equations using MATLAB, exploring various initial conditions and parameter changes.  
- **Equilibrium Analysis**: Evaluates stable and unstable points under different scenarios.  
- **Visualizations**: Phase plots and time-series graphs highlight the dynamics between populations.  

## Dependencies  
- **MATLAB**: For solving differential equations and generating simulations.  
- **MATLAB Toolboxes**: Optimization and plotting toolboxes for enhanced visualizations.  

## Project Highlights  
1. **Mathematical Proofs**: Includes derivations for exponential growth and decay in isolated populations.  
2. **Pesticide Sensitivity**: Shows how population amplitudes reduce due to pesticide exposure.  
3. **Resource Limitations**: Demonstrates how deforestation affects population stability and leads to potential extinction scenarios.  
4. **Simulations**: Models dynamics under varying parameters, including predator mortality rates and prey carrying capacity.
