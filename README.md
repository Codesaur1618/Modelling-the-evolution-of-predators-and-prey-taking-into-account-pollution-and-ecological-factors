# Modelling-the-evolution-of-predators-and-prey-taking-into-account-pollution-and-ecological-factors
This project utilizes the Lotka-Volterra equations to model predator-prey interactions, incorporating factors like pesticide use and deforestation. MATLAB simulations explore how these factors influence population dynamics and ecological stability.
